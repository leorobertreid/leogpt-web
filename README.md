Installation guide:
If you want to test the code for yourself:
1. Clone the project
2. Get 2 terminals open.
3. In the first, cd into, run npm install and run npm run dev
4. In the second, cd into frontend, run npm install and run npm run dev
5. Go on a web browser on http://localhost:3000 and see what you get.

 Only do this if you want to improve the code. If you don't, I'll deploy this web app soon.
